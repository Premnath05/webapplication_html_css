            <h1  style="color:tomato;" >Anime History</h1>
            The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917.
            The history of anime dates back to the early 20th century, with Japan producing its first animated films in the 1910s, influenced
            by Western animation techniques. However, it wasn't until the 1960s, with the work of Osamu Tezuka, often called the "God of Manga,"
            that anime began to take shape as a distinct cultural phenomenon. Tezuka's *Astro Boy* (1963) is considered one of the first major 
            anime TV series, setting the foundation for the animation industry.
            Over the following decades, anime grew in popularity both domestically and internationally,
            with diverse genres and styles emerging. By the 1980s and 1990s, anime had become a global phenomenon,
            with influential works such as *Akira*, *Dragon Ball*, and *Sailor Moon* reaching international audiences.

        <h1>BIG THREE</h1>
        The Big Three was a term used to describe the three most popular
        running series during their golden age in Jump - One Piece, Naruto and Bleach.
        All three series got their common title due to their worldwide popularity and length.
        With that they were always featured in front of the shared Shonen Jump covers with 
        bigger images for their main characters Luffy, Naruto and Ichigo, than the rest of the current lineup of series.
        The three series received long running anime series, Naruto is 720 episodes long, Bleach is 366 episodes long and 
        One Piece has 929 episodes as of June 2020 and with One Piece and Naruto sequel Boruto still airing.
        Those statistics do not include the spin-offs, sequels and movies, so the full numbers for entire franchises are higher.
        All three are shounen (action) series about adventure and drama with a lot of subplots and one main, core plot.
        They have a lot of fight scenes and strong protagonists who are a little foolish and dumb.

        The "Big 3" anime series, which includes Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach,
        are some of the most popular and influential anime and manga series of all time.
        Often referred to as the "father" of the Big 3, Dragon Ball, created by Akira Toriyama,
        paved the way for these series by popularizing the shonen battle genre and setting 
        many of the tropes and conventions that these series would later follow. Dragon Ball's 
        impact on the anime and manga industry is immense,
        and its influence can be seen in numerous aspects of Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach.
